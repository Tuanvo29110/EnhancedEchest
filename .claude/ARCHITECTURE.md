# EnhancedEchest — Architecture

How EnhancedEchest is put together, at a glance. The detail lives in focused topic files under
[`architecture/`](architecture/) — start there when working on a specific area. For day-to-day
conventions see [CLAUDE.md](CLAUDE.md); for end-user documentation see `docs/` (VitePress site).

## Overview

EnhancedEchest intercepts ender chest access and serves a custom inventory GUI backed by a database
instead of the per-player vanilla ender chest. Each player can own **multiple** ender chests, each with
its own size (9–54, multiple of 9), optional custom name, optional icon, and a "primary" flag that
decides which one `/ec` and the ender chest block open.

The guiding invariant is **no item duplication**. A chest's contents exist in exactly one place at a
time: in memory it is backed by a single shared `Inventory` (so concurrent viewers — e.g. an owner and an
admin via `/ee view` — never dupe), and it is loaded fresh from the DB on first open and written back on
last close. **Do not regress this** — see
[architecture/concurrency-and-dupe-safety.md](architecture/concurrency-and-dupe-safety.md).

## Lifecycle

1. **Bootstrap** (`EnhancedEchestBootstrap`): runs before enable; registers the `/ec` and
   `/enhancedechest` command trees against the Brigadier `Commands` registrar, gated by `.requires(...)`.
2. **Enable** (`EnhancedEchestPlugin#onEnable`): loads config + language, builds the storage backend
   (`StorageFactory.create`) and calls `init()` (creates schema), builds the `ContainerCodec` and
   `EnderChestService`, registers listeners, preloads online players' settings, kicks off the async
   update check, and prints a startup banner noting the detected platform (Folia / Paper).
3. **Disable** (`onDisable`): `EnderChestService.shutdown()` persists every still-open session, flushes
   all pending DB saves (blocking up to 30s), and shuts down the executor **before** `storage.close()`.
