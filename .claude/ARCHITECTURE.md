# EnhancedEChest — Architecture

This document describes how EnhancedEChest is put together. For day-to-day conventions see
[CLAUDE.md](CLAUDE.md); for end-user documentation see `docs/`.

## Overview

EnhancedEChest intercepts ender chest access and serves a custom inventory GUI backed by a database
instead of the per-player vanilla ender chest. Each player can own **multiple** ender chests, each
with its own size (9–54, multiple of 9), optional custom name, and a "primary" flag that decides which
one `/ec` and the ender chest block open.

The guiding invariant is **no item duplication**: a chest's contents exist in exactly one place at a
time, and a chest is always loaded fresh from the database on open and written back on close.

## Lifecycle

1. **Bootstrap** (`EnhancedEChestBootstrap`): runs before the plugin is enabled; registers the `/ec`
   and `/enhancedechest` command trees against the Brigadier `Commands` registrar. Commands are
   gated by permission via `.requires(...)`.
2. **Enable** (`EnhancedEChestPlugin#onEnable`): loads config + language, constructs the storage
   backend (`StorageFactory.create`) and calls `init()` (creates schema), builds the
   `ContainerCodec`, `EnderChestService`, registers listeners, kicks off the async update check, and
   prints a startup banner noting the detected platform (Folia / Paper / Spigot).
3. **Disable** (`onDisable`): `EnderChestService.shutdown()` flushes all pending DB saves
   (blocking up to 30s) and shuts down the executor **before** `storage.close()`.

## Open / save flow (dupe-safety)

This is the most important part of the system and must not be regressed.

### Opening

`EnderChestService.open(player, sourceBlock)` (and `openChest(index)`):

1. Hop onto the player's entity thread (`foliaLib.runAtEntity`).
2. Close any existing custom GUI synchronously (`closeExistingGui`) — its close triggers a save.
3. Resolve the chest index (primary, bootstrapping chest #1 via `createChest` if the player owns none).
4. **Wait** for any in-flight save of *that same* `(owner, index)` to finish (`waitPending`), so a
   reopen can never read pre-save data.
5. Load the row from the DB on the async executor.
6. Back on the entity thread, build an inventory with an `EnderChestHolder` and decode the bytes into it.

### Saving

`EnderChestService.save(holder, inventory)`:

1. **Encode** the contents to bytes **synchronously** on the calling (entity) thread — fast, and
   guarantees the snapshot reflects the inventory at close time.
2. Submit the DB write to the async executor, storing the `CompletableFuture` in `pendingSaves`
   keyed by `SaveKey(owner, index)`. The future removes itself on completion.

`waitPending` + this map are what let an open wait for a prior close's write to land. Encoding
failures abort the save (data is **not** written) to avoid corrupting stored bytes.

### Threading summary

- Storage methods are **synchronous** and thread-agnostic (see `EnderChestStorage` Javadoc).
- `EnderChestService` is the **only** dispatcher onto `asyncExecutor` (a daemon cached thread pool
  named `EnhancedEChest-db`).
- Anything touching the player/inventory/block runs on the appropriate region thread via FoliaLib.

## Storage layer

`EnderChestStorage` models ownership as **row existence**: a player owns chest `index` iff a row
exists for `(player_uuid, chest_index)`. There is no separate "owners" table.

`AbstractSqlStorage` holds all DML as plain SQL valid across SQLite, MySQL/MariaDB, and PostgreSQL.
Only the `CREATE TABLE` statement is dialect-specific and is injected by each subclass
(`SqliteStorage`, `MysqlStorage`, `PostgresStorage`). New chest indexes are computed in Java
(`MAX(chest_index)+1`), so no dialect-specific upsert is required. Connections come from a HikariCP
pool (pool size 1 for SQLite, configurable otherwise).

### Schema (`enderchests`)

| Column | Notes |
|--------|-------|
| `player_uuid` | part of PK |
| `chest_index` | part of PK; per-player 1-based index |
| `size` | slot count (multiple of 9, 9–54) |
| `custom_name` | nullable; null → default numbered title |
| `is_primary` | which chest `/ec` opens; exactly one per player |
| `container_data` | nullable serialized bytes (`ContainerCodec`) |
| `migrated` | flag, meaningful on chest #1 only |
| `last_updated` | write timestamp |

Key operations: `createChest` (next index, first chest auto-primary), `ensureChest` (create at a
fixed index if absent — used by migration), `resizeChest`, `deleteChest` (promotes the lowest-index
survivor to primary if the deleted one was primary), `renameChest`, `setPrimary` (clear-then-set in a
transaction), `isMigrated`/`setMigrated`. `saveChest` is **UPDATE-only** and never touches size, name,
or primary.

## Serialization

`ContainerCodec` converts `ItemStack[] ⇄ byte[]`, parameterized by chest size on decode. `MAX_SIZE`
is 54 and `SLOT_STEP` is 9. Decode failures throw `CodecException`, which the service surfaces to the
player (`chest.codec-failed`) and refuses to open rather than risk clobbering stored data.

## Multi-chest UI (Dialog API)

`gui/dialog/ChestDialogs` isolates Paper's experimental Dialog API. Three dialogs:

- **list** — one button per owned chest → opens the detail dialog
- **detail** — Open / Rename / Set-as-main / Back
- **rename** — text input + Save / Cancel (separate dialog, no inline input on detail)

Navigation avoids cursor recentering: forward transitions use client-side
`DialogAction.staticAction(ClickEvent.showDialog(child))` (child dialogs are built first so parents can
reference them), while Back / Cancel / post-mutation paths re-query the DB and re-push via
`player.showDialog`. Dialog label text lives in `gui.yml` under `dialog:` (not `messages.yml`).

## Migration

`MigrationService.migrateOnline(player)` imports a player's 27-slot vanilla ender chest into their
EnhancedEChest chest #1, in a single main-thread tick: ensure chest #1 exists at full size → copy
vanilla contents into its head slots → save to DB → clear the vanilla EC → set the `migrated` flag.
There is never a window where the items exist in both places. Each player migrates once
(`isMigrated` guard). Triggered automatically on join (when `migration.enabled`) via
`JoinMigrationListener`, or manually with `/ee migrate run <player>|all`.

## Config & language

`PluginConfig` reads `config.yml` (language, `enderchest.default-size`, database block, migration
flag) and provides `isValidSize` / `sanitizeSize` (multiple of 9, clamped 9–54). `ConfigMigrations`
defines key-rename rules applied by `YamlMigrator` on load so existing config/language files upgrade
without manual edits.

`LanguageManager` loads `language/<locale>/{messages,gui}.yml`, falling back to `en_US` if the locale
is missing. `parse()` auto-detects MiniMessage (string contains `<`) vs legacy `&` codes. Chest titles:
custom name shown verbatim as plain text; otherwise chest #1 uses the un-numbered `enderchest.title`
and chests 2+ use `enderchest.title-numbered` with `{index}`.

## Updates

`UpdateChecker.checkAsync` runs on a FoliaLib async task at startup; `UpdateNotifyListener` notifies
admins shortly after they join (with a clickable MiniMessage download link).
