# EnhancedEChest — Claude guide

A Paper plugin that replaces the vanilla ender chest with a larger, multi-chest, database-backed
storage system. Players get ender chests of up to **54 slots**, can own several, and manage them
from an in-game dialog. All contents are serialized to SQLite / MySQL / MariaDB / PostgreSQL.

For the full design, read [ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md). For user-facing docs, see `docs/`.

## Build & run

```bash
./gradlew build        # compiles + runs shadowJar (the deliverable)
./gradlew shadowJar    # build the relocated fat jar only
```

- Output jar: `EnhancedEChest-<version>.jar`. `build.gradle.kts` also copies it to a local
  `TestServer/plugins` directory (`shadowJar.destinationDirectory`) — adjust that path if your
  test server lives elsewhere.
- There is no automated test suite yet; verification is done by running on a Paper/Folia server.

## Stack & constraints

- **Java 21**, **Paper API 1.21.11**, Gradle Kotlin DSL, ShadowJar.
- Paper-only APIs are used (`paper-plugin.yml` bootstrapper, Brigadier commands, Dialog API) —
  the plugin does **not** run on plain Spigot/CraftBukkit.
- All third-party libs are **shaded and relocated** under `com.enhancedechest.libs.*`
  (HikariCP, MariaDB driver, PostgreSQL driver, FoliaLib). SQLite driver is `compileOnly`
  (Paper bundles it). Never reference these libs by their original package in new code without
  matching the relocation.
- Base package: `com.enhancedechest`.

## Conventions

- **Threading / Folia:** all scheduling goes through `FoliaLib` so the jar runs on Spigot/Paper/Folia.
  `runAsync` / `runAtEntity` / `runAtLocation` take a `Consumer<WrappedTask>`, **not** a `Runnable`;
  the `*Later` variants have `Runnable` overloads. Never touch entities/blocks off their region thread.
- **DB access is synchronous** in the storage layer; `EnderChestService` is the only place allowed to
  dispatch storage calls onto the async executor. Don't call storage from a region/main thread.
- **Dupe-safety is load-bearing** — do not "optimize" away the load-fresh-on-open / save-on-close /
  pending-save-wait model (see ARCHITECTURE.md). Encoding happens sync; only the DB write is async.
- **Commands** are registered with Paper Brigadier in `EnhancedEChestBootstrap` (LifecycleEvents.COMMANDS),
  not in `plugin.yml`. Permissions default to `op`.
- **Messages:** `LanguageManager.parse()` auto-detects format per string — contains `<` → MiniMessage,
  otherwise legacy `&` codes (with `&#RRGGBB` hex). Default locale files use legacy `&` codes; the
  clickable update link stays MiniMessage. Keys live in `language/<locale>/{messages,gui}.yml`.
- **Config / language migrations:** `ConfigMigrations` + `YamlMigrator` rename keys on load so existing
  installs upgrade cleanly. Add a rename rule there rather than silently changing a key name.

## Docs site

`docs/` is a VitePress site deployed to GitHub Pages by `.github/workflows/deploy-docs.yml`.
`config.mts` sets `base: '/EnhancedEChest/'` for the project page — change it (and add `public/CNAME`)
if a custom domain is set up. Build locally with `cd docs && npm install && npm run docs:build`.
