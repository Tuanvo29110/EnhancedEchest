# EnhancedEchest — Claude guide

A Paper plugin that replaces the vanilla ender chest with a larger, multi-chest, database-backed
storage system. Players get ender chests of up to **54 slots**, can own several, and manage them
from an in-game dialog. All contents are serialized to SQLite / MySQL / MariaDB / PostgreSQL.

For the full design, read [ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md). For user-facing docs, see `docs/`.

## Build & run

```bash
./gradlew build        # compiles + runs shadowJar (the deliverable)
./gradlew shadowJar    # build the relocated fat jar only
```

- Output jar: `EnhancedEchest-<version>.jar`. `build.gradle.kts` also copies it to a local
  `TestServer/plugins` directory (`shadowJar.destinationDirectory`) — adjust that path if your
  test server lives elsewhere.
- There is no automated test suite yet; verification is done by running on a Paper/Folia server.

## Stack & constraints

- **Java 21**, **Paper API 1.21.11** (`paper-api:1.21.11-R0.1-SNAPSHOT`; api-version `1.21`),
  Gradle Kotlin DSL, ShadowJar. Compiled against the lowest supported API (1.21.11) so the jar
  runs on **servers 1.21.11 through 26.2** — don't call APIs newer than 1.21.11.
- Paper-only APIs are used (`paper-plugin.yml` bootstrapper, Brigadier commands, Dialog API) —
  the plugin requires **Paper** (or a Paper-compatible fork such as Purpur / Folia) and does not run
  on CraftBukkit.
- All third-party libs are **shaded and relocated** under `com.enhancedechest.libs.*`
  (HikariCP, MariaDB driver, PostgreSQL driver, FoliaLib). SQLite driver is `compileOnly`
  (Paper bundles it). Never reference these libs by their original package in new code without
  matching the relocation.
- Base package: `com.enhancedechest`.

## Conventions

- **Threading / Folia:** all scheduling goes through `FoliaLib` so the jar runs on Paper/Folia.
  `runAsync` / `runAtEntity` / `runAtLocation` take a `Consumer<WrappedTask>`, **not** a `Runnable`;
  the `*Later` variants have `Runnable` overloads. Never touch entities/blocks off their region thread.
- **DB access is synchronous** in the storage layer; the `com.enhancedechest.service` layer is the only
  place allowed to dispatch storage calls onto the async executor, and it does so through the shared
  `DbExecutor` (pool `EnhancedEchest-db`). Don't call storage from a region/main thread.
- **Dupe-safety is load-bearing** — do not "optimize" away the model: one **shared `Inventory` per open
  chest** (so concurrent viewers can't dupe), load-fresh on first open, save on **last** viewer close,
  pending-save-wait on reopen. All open paths must funnel through `ChestSessionManager.open`; session
  bookkeeping is single-threaded via `onGlobal`. The whole dupe-safety core (the `sessions` registry,
  `runExclusive`, `forceCloseAll`) lives in the one closed class `ChestSessionManager` — keep it there.
  Encoding happens sync; only the DB write is async. Full detail:
  [architecture/concurrency-and-dupe-safety.md](architecture/concurrency-and-dupe-safety.md).
- **Commands** are registered with Paper Brigadier in `EnhancedEchestBootstrap` (LifecycleEvents.COMMANDS),
  not in `plugin.yml`. Permissions default to `op`.
- **Messages:** `LanguageManager.parse()` auto-detects format per string — contains `<` → MiniMessage,
  otherwise legacy `&` codes (with `&#RRGGBB` hex). Default locale files use legacy `&` codes; the
  clickable update link stays MiniMessage. Keys live in `language/<locale>/{messages,gui}.yml`.
- **Config / language migrations:** `ConfigMigrations` + `YamlMigrator` rename keys on load so existing
  installs upgrade cleanly. Add a rename rule there rather than silently changing a key name.
- **Open routing & the "main" chest** (`ChestOpener.open`): `/ec` and right-click decide between
  opening a chest directly vs. showing the `/eclist` management dialog —
  - **0–1 chest** → open it directly (bootstrapping chest #1 if none).
  - **2+ chests + an explicit main flagged + caller has `enhancedechest.command.open`** → open the main directly.
  - **2+ chests otherwise** (no main set, or no permission) → management dialog.
  The main chest is **never auto-assigned**: `createChest`/`ensureChest` insert with `is_primary = 0` and
  deletes do not promote a survivor — it is set only by the dialog's "Set as main" (`setPrimary`). So
  `is_primary` is zero-or-one per player; `getPrimaryIndex`/`SQL_PRIMARY` filters `kind <> 1` (non-TEMP)
  and falls back to the lowest such index when none is flagged (keeps single-chest `/ec` working — and
  lets a PERM chest be opened/set as main). "Real chest" counting in the router is `kind != TEMP` (NORMAL
  **and** PERM). The list marks the main chest with a gold `★` appended to its label (`gui.yml
  dialog.main-tag`); dialog buttons themselves are plain text. Don't reintroduce auto-primary — it breaks
  the "user explicitly chooses their main" model.
- **Per-chest detail dialog & feature toggles** (`ChestDialogs.detailDialog` + `DetailContext`): one
  dialog serves both the owner (`/eclist` edit mode) and an admin (`/ee view`); the `DetailContext` record
  decides the button set and *which owner* every mutation targets (an admin's clicks edit the **target's**
  chest). Appearance edits are gated by **global** config toggles `enderchest.features.{rename,icon,sort}`
  (sort off by default; read live from the shared `PluginConfig`, fields `volatile`) **and** by edit rights
  (owner always; admin needs `enhancedechest.admin.edit`). **Sort** (`ChestSpillService.sortChest`) is
  dupe-safe like `clearChest` (force-close + `runExclusive`, merge-similar then reorder by material key) and
  is per-clicker rate-limited by `enderchest.features.sort-cooldown` in `ChestOpener`. Don't split the admin
  detail back into a separate dialog — it's intentionally the same path. See
  [architecture/ui-dialogs.md](architecture/ui-dialogs.md).
- **Permission-granted chests** (`ChestKind.PERM`, `kind = 2`): players are granted chests from
  `enhancedechest.additional_amount.<count>.slot.<size>` permissions (stacking, summed per size), gated by
  `permission-chests.enabled`. `PermissionChestService.reconcile` runs **on open** (via `ChestOpener`,
  reusing the already-fetched list) to grant/resize/revoke PERM chests against the player's permissions;
  revoked chests spill items to a temp chest. The base NORMAL chest is inviolable (reconcile bootstraps it
  first; never deleted/overridden). To players a PERM chest behaves **exactly** like NORMAL (no tag, no
  hidden buttons); admin commands skip it (`/ee resize` → `admin.cannot-modify-perm`, `/ee delete` is
  NORMAL-only). Reuses the existing `kind` column — no schema change. See
  [architecture/commands-and-permissions.md](architecture/commands-and-permissions.md#permission-granted-chests).

## Docs site

`docs/` is a VitePress site deployed to GitHub Pages by `.github/workflows/deploy-docs.yml`.
`config.mts` sets `base: '/EnhancedEchest/'` for the project page — change it (and add `public/CNAME`)
if a custom domain is set up. Build locally with `cd docs && npm install && npm run docs:build`.
