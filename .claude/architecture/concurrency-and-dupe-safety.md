# Open / save flow, shared sessions & dupe-safety

> The single most important part of the system. **Do not regress the dupe-safety model.**
> Cross-refs: [storage-and-schema.md](storage-and-schema.md) (DB serialization), [commands-and-permissions.md](commands-and-permissions.md) (`/ee view`, read-only), [expiry-and-temp-chests.md](expiry-and-temp-chests.md) (item-moving ops).

The guiding invariant is **no item duplication**: a chest's contents exist in exactly one place at a
time. This is enforced on two levels:

- **In memory** — every open chest is backed by **one shared `Inventory`** (the *session*), so two
  concurrent viewers (e.g. owner + admin) mutate the same `ItemStack[]` and Bukkit serialises their
  moves. Item-level duping between viewers is structurally impossible on a single-threaded platform.
- **At the DB** — a chest is loaded fresh on its first open and written back when its **last** viewer
  closes; a re-open waits for any in-flight save of that same chest first (`pendingSaves` / `waitPending`).

All of this lives in `EnderChestService`.

## Open routing (`/ec`, right-click) — `open(player, sourceBlock)`

Lists the player's chests and decides what to show (unchanged by the shared-session work):

- **0 or 1 normal chest, no temp chest** → open it directly (bootstrapping chest #1 via `createChest`
  if the player owns none).
- **2+ chests, an explicit main flagged *and* caller has `enhancedechest.command.open`** → open the
  flagged main directly.
- **2+ chests otherwise** (no main chosen, or no permission), or **any TEMP chest present** → show the
  `/eclist` management dialog.

A main is **never** auto-assigned (`is_primary = 0` on insert; deletes don't promote a survivor). The
list marks the main with a gold `★`. See [ui-dialogs.md](ui-dialogs.md) and
[storage-and-schema.md](storage-and-schema.md) for the primary-resolution details.

## The shared live-inventory registry

`EnderChestService.sessions` is a `ConcurrentHashMap<SaveKey(owner,index), Session>`. A `Session` holds:

| field | meaning |
|-------|---------|
| `inv` | the one shared `Inventory` (null until the first load finishes) |
| `viewers` | UUIDs currently viewing it |
| `viewerBlocks` | per-viewer source block, for the lid open/close animation |
| `waiting` | opens queued until the first load completes |
| `ready` / `closing` | lifecycle flags |

**Every session mutation runs on a single bookkeeping thread** via `onGlobal(Runnable)` — the main
thread on Paper, the global region thread on Folia (`foliaLib.getScheduler().isGlobalTickThread()` /
`runNextTick`). This removes registry-level races on both platforms. The DB read/write stays async; the
synchronous *encode* only ever happens once **all** viewers have closed, so it never races a live edit.

### Opening — `openShared` is the single funnel

Every open path goes through `openShared(player, owner, index, sourceBlock)`:
`open` → `openPrimaryChest`/`openChest`; the dialog "Open" button → `openChest`; admin → `adminOpen`.
**If you add a new way to open a chest, route it here** — a second independently-loaded `Inventory`
re-introduces duping.

1. On the player's entity thread: `closeExistingGui(player)` (its close fires `detach`, see below), then
   hop to `onGlobal` → `decideOpen`.
2. `decideOpen` (global thread):
   - **Live session exists & not closing** → attach. On **Folia**, if another viewer already holds it,
     deny with `chest.in-use` (single-viewer rule, below). If `ready`, `addViewerAndOpen`; else queue in
     `waiting`.
   - **No session** → create one, put it in the map, then `waitPending(owner,index)` → async
     `storage.loadChest` → `finishCreate` on the global thread.
3. `finishCreate` builds the shared `Inventory` (`buildSharedInventory`, decoding the bytes; aborts on
   `CodecException`), marks the session `ready`, and flushes the `waiting` queue via `addViewerAndOpen`.
   If a force-close superseded the session mid-load, waiters get `chest.not-found`.
4. `addViewerAndOpen` registers the viewer on the global thread, then `player.openInventory(inv)` on the
   player's entity thread (and plays the open lid animation if a source block was supplied).

### Closing & saving — `detach` + `persist`

The GUI close and quit listeners call `service.detach(player, holder)` (they no longer call `save`):

1. On the global thread, remove the player from `viewers` (and play the close animation from their
   `viewerBlocks` entry).
2. If a force-close set `closing`, do nothing (that path owns the save).
3. If this was the **last** viewer (`viewers` and `waiting` both empty), remove the session and
   `persist` it.

`persist(session)` mirrors the old `save`: encode the shared contents **synchronously** on the global
thread, then write on the async executor, registering the future in `pendingSaves` keyed by
`(owner,index)`. An emptied TEMP chest deletes its row instead (via `runExclusive`). Encode failures
abort the write (data is **not** corrupted).

> A non-last viewer closing does **not** save — the remaining viewers keep editing the one live
> inventory. This is what makes concurrent editing safe and avoids redundant writes.

### Force-close for item-moving ops — `forceCloseAll`

Admin resize/delete and the expiry sweeper must mutate a chest that may be open in several viewers.
`forceCloseAll(owner, index)` (replaces the old `forceCloseIfOpen`):

1. Global thread: set `closing`, dispatch `closeInventory()` to **every** viewer on their entity thread.
2. After all closes complete, `persist` the (now quiescent) shared inventory and remove the session.
3. The returned future completes once the save is registered in `pendingSaves`, so the caller can chain
   `runExclusive(...)` and have the DB op serialise behind that save.

Because the persist runs only after all viewer screens have closed, the encode reads an inventory no
one is editing — safe even on Folia. See [expiry-and-temp-chests.md](expiry-and-temp-chests.md) for the
full item-moving transaction model.

## Concurrent editing: Paper vs Folia

- **Paper** — all viewers' inventory events run on the main thread, so a shared inventory is
  fully safe: **owner and admin (and multiple admins) can edit the same chest at once.**
- **Folia** — viewers may live on different region threads, where a shared `ItemStack[]` is unsafe. So
  Folia allows **only one live viewer per chest**; a second opener (including the owner if an admin is
  viewing) is denied with `chest.in-use`. `decideOpen` enforces this via `foliaLib.isFolia()` +
  `isOccupiedByOther`.

## DB-level serialization primitives (unchanged)

- `pendingSaves: Map<SaveKey, CompletableFuture<Void>>` — in-flight save/op per `(owner,index)`.
- `waitPending(owner,index)` — an open waits on the prior write before loading.
- `runExclusive(owner,index, dbWork)` — chains arbitrary DB work behind the pending future and registers
  its own marker, so a concurrent open waits for it.

## Threading summary

- Storage methods are **synchronous** and thread-agnostic (see `EnderChestStorage` Javadoc).
- `EnderChestService` is the **only** dispatcher onto `asyncExecutor` (daemon cached pool `EnhancedEchest-db`).
- Session bookkeeping is single-threaded via `onGlobal`.
- Anything touching a player/inventory/block runs on the right region thread via FoliaLib.
- On shutdown, `persistOpenSessions()` saves every still-open session, then `flushPendingSaves()` blocks
  (≤30s) for all writes before the executor and storage close.
