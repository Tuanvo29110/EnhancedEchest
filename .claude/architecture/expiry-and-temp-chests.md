# Expiry & temporary chests

Chests can expire, and items that no longer fit anywhere spill into **temporary chests** instead of
being lost silently.

- **Temp chest (`kind = TEMP`)** — an overflow holder created automatically when items are cut off by a
  shrink, a non-`force` delete, or a normal chest expiring with items inside. It always carries an
  `expires_at` (config `temp-enderchest.expiry`, default `24h`), is never primary, and cannot be renamed
  or set-as-main in the dialog (Open + Back only). It is **take-only** (deposits are cancelled for
  everyone, including admins — see [ui-dialogs.md](ui-dialogs.md) / `EnderChestGuiListener`). It
  **auto-deletes the moment it is emptied** (`persist` deletes the row instead of writing an empty temp),
  and on expiry it is hard-deleted with any remaining items **permanently lost**.
- **Expiring normal chest** — `/ee add <player> <size> <duration>` grants a `kind = NORMAL` chest with an
  `expires_at`. On expiry its items spill into a temp chest, then the chest is removed.

## Sweeper (`expiry/ExpirySweeper`)

A FoliaLib async repeating timer at `temp-enderchest.check-interval` (default `5m`). Each tick runs
`findExpired(now)` (one indexed query on a column that is `NULL` for almost every row) and routes each
hit through the service — NORMAL → `removeChest(..., force=false)` (spill), TEMP →
`removeChest(..., force=true)` (discard). Expiry is deliberately **swept, not lazy on access**, so the hot
open/close path stays free of expiry filtering and the dangerous mutation is centralised in one
serialized place.

## Dupe-safety for item-moving ops

Every item-moving op — shrink spill, delete spill, normal-chest expiry spill, temp auto-delete, temp
expiry — goes through `EnderChestService` and reuses the model in
[concurrency-and-dupe-safety.md](concurrency-and-dupe-safety.md):

1. `forceCloseAll(owner, index)` closes the GUI of **every** viewer of the affected chest, then persists
   the shared inventory and registers the save in `pendingSaves` before the op proceeds.
2. `runExclusive(owner, index, dbWork)` chains the work behind that pending save (and any other op for
   the key) and registers its own marker, so a concurrent `open` waits for it.
3. The actual row changes happen in **one transaction**:
   - `spillShrink`: UPDATE original to the new size/contents + INSERT temp holding the overflow.
   - `spillRemove`: INSERT temp + DELETE original (**no** primary promotion — the main is an explicit
     player choice).
   The temp index is `MAX(chest_index)+1` computed inside that same transaction, so items never exist in
   two rows visible to any outside reader.

Encoding stays synchronous (`ContainerCodec`); only the DB write runs on the async executor.

## `DurationFormat` (`util/`)

Parses time strings (`20s`, `5m`, `1h`, `1d_2h_30m`; units `s m h d w mo y`, with `mo = 30d` and
`y = 365d`) and formats the static "expires in" snapshot shown on dialog buttons (a live ticking
countdown is impossible with the static Dialog API).
