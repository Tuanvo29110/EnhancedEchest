# Changelog

All notable changes to EnhancedEchest are recorded here, newest first.

## 1.0.6 - 2026-07-04

This release adds a built-in tool to move all your data from one database backend to another, plus a set of performance improvements aimed at servers with many players online.

### Added

- Added coloured chest names: players can now format a chest's custom name with `&` colour codes, `&#RRGGBB` hex, and cosmetic MiniMessage tags such as `<red>`, `<gradient>`, and `<rainbow>`.
  - Interactive MiniMessage tags (`<click>`, `<hover>`, `<insertion>`, …) are always stripped, so a name can never run a command or forge a tooltip.
  - Controlled by the new `enderchest.features.rename-colors` toggle (on by default); turn it off to show names exactly as typed.
- Added a name blacklist for chest renaming: set `enderchest.features.rename-blacklist` in `config.yml` to a list of words players may not use in a chest's custom name (for example `server`, `admin`, `staff`, `owner`).
  - Matching is case-insensitive and by substring, so a banned word like `admin` also blocks names such as `iAmAdmin` or `ADMIN`.
  - The check runs against the visible text, so colour codes can't be used to hide a banned word.
  - A rename containing a banned word is rejected before it is saved, and the player is asked to choose a different name.
  - Leave the list empty to allow any name; clearing a chest's name is always allowed.
- Added `/ee import` to copy every player's chests from an old database backend into the one your server is currently using, for example when moving from SQLite to MySQL, or between MySQL and PostgreSQL.
  - Point `config.yml` at the new (empty) backend, restart, then run `/ee import` and fill in the old database's connection details in the dialog.
  - The copy is byte-for-byte, so item contents, sizes, names, icons, and settings all carry over exactly, and it stays fast even for large databases.
  - Safety checks before it runs: no other players may be online, the source cannot be the database you are already on, and the destination must be empty.
  - Everything is copied in a single transaction, so a failure part-way leaves the destination untouched: just fix the problem and run it again.
  - Gated by the new `enhancedechest.admin.import` permission.

### Fixed

- Fixed `/ee migrate` appearing in tab-completion for players without the `enhancedechest.admin.migrate` permission. The command still could not be run, but it should not have been suggested; the whole `/ee migrate` subtree is now hidden unless the player has the permission.
- Fixed a rare case where migrating a player's vanilla ender chest (on join with `migration.enabled`, or via `/ee migrate vanilla`) while that player had their ender chest open could lose the migrated items. An ender chest opened during a migration now simply waits for it and then shows the migrated items.
- Fixed vanilla migration replacing whatever was already stored in chest #1: it now merges the vanilla items into free slots, anything that does not fit is moved to a recoverable temporary chest (the chest is never resized), and running the migration twice can no longer duplicate or drop anything.

### Improved

- Improved join performance when `migration.enabled` is on: the already-migrated check no longer runs on the main server thread, so mass reconnects after a restart no longer cause lag.
- Improved chest opening on busy servers: a chest's contents are now read and prepared fully in the background with fewer database queries, so opening chests adds less load to the server tick.
- Improved SQLite write performance by switching the database to write-ahead logging. You may see new `enderchests.db-wal` and `enderchests.db-shm` files next to the database file; they belong to SQLite and should be left in place.
- Improved SQLite reliability during automatic backups: a save that arrives while a backup is being written now waits for it to finish instead of failing.

## 1.0.5 - 2026-07-03

### Fixed

- Fixed an error that could prevent the plugin from starting when `database.type` is set to `mysql`, `mariadb`, or `postgres`, failing with `No suitable driver` even with a correct `host`, `port`, `database`, `username`, and `password`.

## 1.0.4 - 2026-07-02

This release lets you set a player's base ender chest size by rank, makes `/ee view` reliable for offline players, and adds an automatic, versioned database upgrader.

### Added

- Added the `enhancedechest.default_size.<size>` permission to set a player's base ender chest size by rank, separate from `enderchest.default-size`. For example, `enhancedechest.default_size.54` gives that player a 54-slot base chest.
  - If a player holds more than one, the largest size wins.
  - The chest resizes itself as soon as the permission changes. Growing it keeps every item; shrinking it moves anything that no longer fits into a recoverable temporary chest.
  - While set this way, `/ee resize` cannot change that chest, the same as a permission-granted chest. Works for offline players too.
  - Applies the next time the player opens their chest, no relog needed, with nothing to configure.
- `/ee view`, `/ee add`, `/ee resize`, `/ee delete`, and `/ee transfer` now find offline players reliably, including while typing a name for tab completion, instead of depending on the server's own player list.

### Changed

- Upgrading the plugin now updates your database automatically. Your existing chests and settings are always kept, and no manual steps are needed.

## 1.0.3 - 2026-06-29

This release adds one-click chest sorting, lets you turn the chest customization buttons on or off server-wide, and gives admins the full chest menu while viewing another player.

### Added

- Added a **Sort** button to a chest's management menu that tidies it in one click: identical items are merged into full stacks and the whole chest is reordered by item type.
  - Off by default. Turn it on with `enderchest.features.sort: true` in `config.yml`.
  - Has a per-player cooldown (default `10s`, configurable with `enderchest.features.sort-cooldown`) so it can't be spammed.
- Added server-wide on/off switches under `enderchest.features` in `config.yml` for the chest customization buttons. Each switch applies to every player the same way.
  - `rename` (default on): show or hide the **Rename** button.
  - `icon` (default on): show or hide the **Choose icon** button.
  - `sort` (default off): show or hide the **Sort** button.

### Changed

- `/ee view <player>` now opens the **same** management menu the chest's owner sees, instead of a stripped-down view-only one:
  - Admins with `enhancedechest.admin.edit` can now **Rename**, **Choose icon**, and **Sort** the chest they are viewing (these follow the same `enderchest.features` switches).
  - The **Clear chest** button now lives in that same menu, so everything is in one place.
  - A view-only admin (`enhancedechest.admin.view` only) still sees just Open and Back.

## 1.0.2 - 2026-06-27

This release focuses on importing existing data from other vault plugins, and adds an account-transfer command plus an admin tool to empty a chest.

### Added

- Added migration from the `AxVaults` plugin. Items keep their custom names, lore, and enchantments, and each vault maps to the EnhancedEchest chest with the same number.
  - `/ee migrate axvaults` imports every player in the AxVaults database.
  - `/ee migrate axvaults <player>` imports a single player, online or offline.
- Added migration from the `PlayerVaultsX` plugin, read directly from its vault files. Works for offline players.
  - `/ee migrate playervaultsx` imports every player with PlayerVaultsX data.
  - `/ee migrate playervaultsx <player>` imports a single player, online or offline.
- Added `/ee transfer <from> <to> <#index | name | all>` to move a player's ender chests onto another account, for when someone switches accounts.
  - Use `all` to move every chest, or a `#index` or chest name to move a single one.
  - The destination ends up with exactly the source's chests: nothing from the destination account is stacked on top, and the source's chests are removed so items are never duplicated.
  - If the destination already holds items in a chest the transfer would replace, add `override` to discard them or `temp` to move them to recoverable temporary storage.
  - Gated by the new `enhancedechest.admin.transfer` permission.
- Added a **Clear chest** button to the `/ee view` menu that empties a chest's contents. It is visible only to admins with the new `enhancedechest.admin.clear` permission, is tagged with a red `(Admin)` label, and asks for confirmation before wiping anything.

### Changed

- **Breaking:** `/ee migrate run` is now `/ee migrate vanilla`, and `/ee migrate run all` is now `/ee migrate vanilla all`. Update any console scripts or command blocks that call the old name.
- **Breaking:** the migration permission node `enhancedechest.admin.migrate.run` is now `enhancedechest.admin.migrate`. Re-grant this node to your staff.
- `/ee view <player>` and `/ee view <player> <index>` now open a per-chest menu (with Open, and Clear chest for admins who have the permission) instead of opening the inventory immediately. Click Open in the menu to open the chest.

### Improved

- Improved vanilla migration on `Purpur` and Paper forks: enlarged ender chests are now imported in full, up to all 54 slots, instead of only the first 27.
- Improved the update checker so it falls back to GitHub releases when Modrinth cannot be reached, pointing players to the GitHub download instead.
- Improved how chest contents are stored so saved data is more compact.
