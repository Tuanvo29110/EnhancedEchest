# EnhancedEChest

EnhancedEChest is a Paper plugin that gives every player a private **54-slot** ender chest instead of the default 27. All items are saved to a database, so storage persists across restarts and world resets.

## Features

- Double-size ender chest (54 slots) opened through the normal ender chest block or `/ec`
- Database-backed storage with support for SQLite (built-in, zero setup) and MySQL / MariaDB
- No item duplication: inventory is loaded fresh on open and saved immediately on close
- Migration system to import existing vanilla ender chest contents on first join
- No external dependencies required on the server; everything is bundled in the jar

## Requirements

- Paper 1.21.11 or newer
- Java 21 or newer

> Spigot and other forks are not supported.

## Installation

1. Download the latest `.jar` from the [Releases](../../releases) page.
2. Drop it into your server's `plugins/` folder.
3. Restart the server.

The plugin creates `plugins/EnhancedEChest/config.yml` and a SQLite database file automatically on first startup.

## Configuration

`plugins/EnhancedEChest/config.yml`:

```yaml
language: en_US              # Locale folder to load messages from

database:
  type: sqlite               # Use "sqlite" or "mysql"
  sqlite-file: enderchests.db

  # Fill these in only if you use MySQL / MariaDB
  host: localhost
  port: 3306
  database: enhancedechest
  username: root
  password: ""
  pool-size: 10

migration:
  enabled: false             # Set to true to auto-import vanilla ender chest data on first join
```

After changing the config, run `/enhancedechest reload` to apply without restarting.
