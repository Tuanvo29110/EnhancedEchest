# Welcome to EnhancedEChest

**EnhancedEChest** is a free, open-source Minecraft plugin that upgrades the vanilla ender chest into a larger, persistent, multi-chest storage system. Instead of three cramped rows that live inside a single player file, every player gets ender chests of up to **54 slots** — saved to a real database so the contents survive restarts, world resets, and server migrations.

## Why EnhancedEChest?

<CardGrid>

<FeatureCard icon="📦" title="More Space">
The vanilla ender chest holds 27 items. EnhancedEChest gives players a configurable chest of up to 54 slots — a full double chest — opened from the same ender chest block or the <code>/ec</code> command.
</FeatureCard>

<FeatureCard icon="🗂️" title="Multiple Chests Per Player">
Players are no longer limited to a single ender chest. Admins can grant extra chests, each with its own size and custom name, switchable from an in-game management menu.
</FeatureCard>

<FeatureCard icon="💾" title="Real Persistence">
All contents are stored in a database — SQLite out of the box, or MySQL / MariaDB / PostgreSQL for networks. Data is shared cleanly across restarts and, with a shared database, across servers.
</FeatureCard>

<FeatureCard icon="🛡️" title="Dupe-Proof by Design">
Contents are loaded fresh when a chest is opened and written immediately when it closes. A pending-save chain guarantees the next open never reads stale data — closing the door on reload-based duplication.
</FeatureCard>
