 * column — see {@code PlayerSettingsCache#setUsernameAsync}), used to answer offline-player
 * tab-completion and name resolution from memory instead of hitting the DB on every keystroke.
 *
 * <p>Unlike {@link PlayerSettingsCache} (bounded to online players, evicted on quit), this index holds
 * every known player for the lifetime of the server — it is loaded once in full via {@link #loadAll}
 * at startup and kept in sync afterward by a single {@link #put} call per name change, so it never
 * needs a DB round-trip on the command/suggestion hot path.
 *
 * <p>Keyed by lower-cased name in a {@link ConcurrentSkipListMap} (not a plain hash map) specifically
 * so prefix search — the shape every tab-completion query actually needs — is a {@code subMap} range
 * lookup, O(log n + k) for k matches, rather than an O(n) scan of the whole roster. Lock-free reads
 * make it safe to call from Brigadier suggestion callbacks (main thread) while an async name update is
 * landing concurrently.
