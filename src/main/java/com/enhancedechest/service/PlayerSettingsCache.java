/**
 * Write-through read cache of per-player settings, keyed by UUID. Populated on join
 * ({@link #preloadSettings}), read by the dialog-open paths, updated in place on change, and evicted
 * on quit ({@link #evictSettings}) — so it is bounded by the online-player count. Writes go straight
 * to the DB (write-through), so the cache holds no dirty state and needs no shutdown flush. See the
 * leak-free invariant documented on {@link #preloadSettings}.
 *
 * <p>The DB name index is <b>not</b> written unconditionally here — {@link #setUsernameAsync} is called
 * lazily by {@code ChestOpener}'s shared open prelude, the first time a player actually opens their
 * ender chest (or the list/right-click equivalents), reusing the settings row already loaded there.
 * That same call also updates the in-memory {@link PlayerNameIndex} so offline tab-completion sees the
 * new name immediately, without waiting for a restart to reload it.
